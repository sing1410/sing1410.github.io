    Hii!! I'm Mandeep Singh but you can address me, Mandy. I'm 18 years old and just completed my high school education from Punjab, India. I'm very passionate about web designing and web development. So, I started learning about web development/designing at the age of 16 through some online platforms like udemy, skillshare, YouTube, etc. and got a piece of good basic knowledge about everything. 
    Apart from this, I like to play video games, watching movies, and listen to music, and a big fan of the Spider-man character. I always enjoy making new friends and share the knowledge I have about new technologies, games, movies, and comics. I also love to eat healthy food but I don't like the gym.
