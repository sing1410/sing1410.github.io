    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #4158D0;"> Hii!! I'm <strong>Mandeep Singh</strong> but you can address me, <em>Mandy</em>. I'm 18 years old and just completed my high school education from Punjab, India.
         I'm very passionate about web designing and web development.
          So, I started learning about web development/designing at the age of 16 through some online platforms like <u>udemy</u>, <u>skillshare</u>, <u>YouTube</u>, etc. and got a piece of good basic knowledge about everything.</p>
   <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #4158D0;"> Apart from this, I like to play video games, watching movies, and listen to music, and a big fan of the <strong>Spider-man</strong> character.
        I always enjoy making new friends and share the knowledge I have about <em>new technologies, games, movies, and comics</em>.
         I also love to eat healthy food but I don't like the gym.</p>
